# Development Rules

## Component Structure

1.  **NO components in `app` folder**: All React components should be placed in `components/` directory, organized by feature or type. The `app` directory is strictly for routing and pages.

## AI Integration

- Ensure all AI dependencies are installed: `ai`, `@ai-sdk/google`, `@ai-sdk/react`.
